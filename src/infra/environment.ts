/**
 * Writes the CLI shims and the isolated git configuration that bind a run to the agent's accounts.
 *
 * Each shim strips its own directory from PATH before it execs, so a wrapper script that resolves `gh` by name reaches the
 * real binary instead of looping. The git configuration replaces the operator's global configuration for the run, so a
 * worker cannot push with the operator's credentials.
 *
 * These are guardrails, not an OS boundary: a run shares the operator's OS user and can read their home directory.
